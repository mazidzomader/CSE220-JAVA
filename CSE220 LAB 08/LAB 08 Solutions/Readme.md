 # Important Notice for Running these files

To successfully run these files, `graph.java`,`EdgeNode.java` and `LinkedList.java` must be executed first and then to test files, `Graph_Tester.java` should be run. This file serves as the entry point and initializes all necessary components for the rest of the files to function properly.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Execute `graph.java`,`EdgeNode.java` and `LinkedList.java` first.**
   - This file sets up essential configurations and dependencies that the other files rely on.
   
2. Once `graph.java`,`EdgeNode.java` and `LinkedList.java` are running, you can execute the `Graph_Tester.java` in the project as needed.

## Note

Skipping this step may result in errors or incomplete functionality, as the other files depend on the setup performed in `graph.java`,`EdgeNode.java` and `LinkedList.java`.
